# vectara-ingest as a Conda Package

This document outlines how use the vectara-ingest conda package.

## Prerequisites
- Python 3.11
- Install [Miniconda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html) or [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/download/)
- Install conda-build: `conda install conda-build conda-verify`


## Choose one of the following installation methods:

   **Option A: Install directly in your base environment**
   ```bash
   conda install vectara::vectara-ingest -c conda-forge
   ```

   **Option B: Install in a dedicated environment (recommended)**
   ```bash
   # Create a new conda environment
   conda create -n vectara-ingest python=3.11
   
   # Activate the conda environment
   conda activate vectara-ingest
   
   # Install the package
   conda install vectara::vectara-ingest -c conda-forge
   ```

## Using the Package

### Command-Line Interface

After installing vectara-ingest, you can run it using the command-line interface:

```bash
vectara-ingest --config-file your_config.yaml --profile default --secrets-path path/to/secrets.toml
```

### Running on Red Hat Linux / Amazon Linux

If you're using Red Hat Linux, Amazon Linux, or other Red Hat-based distributions, follow these steps to ensure Playwright works correctly.

1. Create a Conda Environment with Python 3.11

```bash
# Install conda if not already installed
# For miniconda (recommended):
wget https://repo.anaconda.com/miniconda/Miniconda3-latest-Linux-x86_64.sh
bash Miniconda3-latest-Linux-x86_64.sh

# Create a conda environment with Python 3.11
conda create -n vectara-ingest python=3.11
conda activate vectara-ingest

# Install vectara-ingest from conda
conda install vectara::vectara-ingest -c conda-forge
```

2. Install System Dependencies for Playwright

Playwright requires several system dependencies that need to be installed using yum:

```bash
# Core dependencies
sudo yum install -y alsa-lib gtk3 libX11-xcb libXcomposite libXcursor libXdamage \
  libXext libXi libXrandr libXtst mesa-libgbm pango cups-libs

# Fonts
sudo yum install -y liberation-fonts dejavu-sans-fonts

# Additional dependencies if available
sudo yum install -y libcanberra-gtk3 atk || true
```

3. Install Firefox Browser

vectara-ingest uses Firefox for web crawling. Install it using:

```bash
# Install Firefox for Playwright
playwright install firefox
```

4. Known Issues

- The command `python -m playwright install-deps` will not work on Red Hat-based systems as it uses apt-get (Ubuntu's package manager)
- You may see warnings about "OS is not officially supported by Playwright" - this is expected and the fallback build should work fine with the system dependencies installed above
- If you encounter browser-related issues, ensure all system dependencies are properly installed


### As an Importable Python Package

You can use vectara-ingest as a Python package in your own code.

```python
from vectara_ingest import run_ingest

# Configure your ingestion parameters
config_file = "config.yaml"
profile = "profile to use form secrets.toml"
secrets_path = "~/vectara/secrets.toml"
reset_corpus = False # Set to True to delete all documents in the corpus before indexing

# Call the run_ingest function directly
run_ingest(
    config_file=config_file,
    profile=profile,
    secrets_path=secrets_path,
    reset_corpus=reset_corpus
)
```

This allows you to integrate vectara-ingest into your own Python applications or workflows.

### Parameter Explanation

- `config_file`: Path to your YAML configuration file (required)
- `profile`: Profile name in your secrets.toml file (required)
- `secrets_path`: Path to your secrets.toml file (optional, defaults to looking for secrets.toml in current directory)
- `reset_corpus`: Flag to reset the corpus before indexing (optional, defaults to False)

## SSL Certificate Handling

If your Vectara instance uses custom SSL certificates, the CLI package supports several ways to configure certificate verification:

### Configuration in YAML

In your configuration YAML file, add the `ssl_verify` parameter under the `vectara` section:

```yaml
vectara:
  # Other Vectara settings...
  ssl_verify: /path/to/ca.pem
```

### SSL Certificate Options

- You can use absolute paths: `/etc/ssl/certs/mycert.pem`
- You can use home directory paths: `~/certs/mycert.pem`

### Certificate Path Resolution

The package uses the following approach to find certificate files:

1. First tries the direct path as specified (works with absolute paths)
2. Then tries the expanded path (resolves `~` to home directory)
3. Raises an error if the certificate cannot be found at either location

### Auto-Detection

If you don't specify `ssl_verify` in your configuration, the package will automatically look for:

1. A file named `ca.pem` in the current working directory

If found, this will be used for SSL verification.

### Environment-Specific Notes

- In CLI mode, certificate paths are resolved relative to your local filesystem
- Absolute paths must exist on your local system
- Paths with `~` are expanded to your home directory

## Building and Publishing the Conda Package

### Using GitHub Actions

The repository includes a GitHub Action workflow that automatically builds and publishes the conda package for macOS, Windows, and Linux platforms to Anaconda.org.

To use this workflow:

1. Ensure you have an Anaconda.org account and have generated an API token
2. Add your Anaconda API token as a GitHub repository secret named `ANACONDA_TOKEN`
3. Trigger the workflow in one of two ways:
   - Manually: Go to the "Actions" tab in your GitHub repository, select the "Build and Publish Conda Package" workflow, click "Run workflow", and enter the version number
   - Automatically: Create a new release in your GitHub repository, and the workflow will use the release tag as the version number

The workflow will:
- Build the conda package for three platforms (Red Hat Linux, macOS, Windows)
- Update the version in the meta.yaml file
- Upload the built packages to your Anaconda.org channel

#### Red Hat Linux Build

The workflow builds specifically for Red Hat-based Linux distributions (CentOS, RHEL, Amazon Linux):

- Built using a CentOS Stream 9 container for compatibility with Red Hat systems
- Includes all necessary system dependencies for Playwright and Firefox
- Can be installed with: `conda install vectara::vectara-ingest -c conda-forge`

This Red Hat-focused build ensures compatibility with Red Hat-based systems, which is the recommended Linux platform for this package. The build process installs all the required system dependencies mentioned in the "Running on Red Hat Linux" section above, so you don't need to install them separately when using the conda package.

### Building Locally

If you prefer to build the package locally:

```bash
# Install conda-build and anaconda-client
conda install conda-build anaconda-client

# Build the package
conda build conda --output-folder ./conda-bld

# Upload to Anaconda.org (requires login)
anaconda login
anaconda upload ./conda-bld/*/vectara-ingest-*.tar.bz2
```
